After the Great War, the city was heavily bombed and turned into an ashen canyon of crumbling building and bombed-out bridges, and the amount of dust and radioactive basin plunged the city into an endless night, the sun can not break this artificial fog. Most survivors of this apocalypse were turned into ghouls. After becoming aware of their condition, their first objective was to establish a \"paradise\" free of humans and other mutants, where they can live in peace, and the city was renamed \"Los\" (play on words between the former name of the city and their status of lost in this devastated world). Despite wanting to stay between them, the ghouls of Los were friendly and showed great hospitality towards human strangers, allowing them to trade, and thus to survive. But a local civil war in the Secret Vault caused major damage to the Vault. The people of the Vault were divided and some, blocked because of the damage, or wanting to leave the vault, joined the surface with weapons and the city of Los, conducted by Blake, the old security officer of the Secret Vault. Once on the surface, Blake formed the Church of the Lost, giving themselves a holy mission to protect people against the Secret Vault, as they consider it to hold an evil inside, that should never be released, and he took control of the city. Everything changes again in Los when an army of Super Mutants, led by Attis, attacks the city. They quickly make their way to the only remaining entrance to the Vault and take it over, leaving only few of their soldiers to protect the entrance from raging ghoul fanatics of the Church of the Lost.
